<h1>HOWTO use Tm</h1>
<p>The Tm class breaks a date and time down to individual components, of year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond, and weekday specific to a TimeZone.</p>
<p>Tm is similar in purpose to the struct tm in C, but provides its own methods and treats
months as numbered by 1 through 12 instead of zero-based.  You would use Tm if you want to
either decompose a time down to individual units to perform calculations, or to use calculated
time components to build up to a date and time.</p>

<h3>Usage Examples</h3>
<pre>
DateTime nowDT=new DateTime();
DateTime hourDT=nowDT.truncate(CalendarUnit.HOUR);
</pre>
Calculations can be chained left to right, so that 10:00pm yesterday could be calculated as the following:
<pre>
DateTime tenPM=new DateTime().truncate(CalendarUnit.DAY).add(CalendarUnit.HOUR,-2);
</pre>
<h2>DateTime's Parser</h2>
A parser is a process that interprets a String or other data format.  DateTime's date parser is unusually flexible and robust.  It uses
heuristics to determine dates, times, and timezones, rather than a specific set of formats.  The result of this approach is that data
with wide variations of formats, such as resumes, job applications, or web form fields, can be easily interpreted with very few rejected
values.  Passing a String to DateTime's constructor will cause it to parse the String as a DateTime.
<pre>
DateTime dob1=new DateTime("1/26/69");
DateTime dob2=new DateTime("January 26, 1969 at 3:21 PM");
DateTime dob3=new DateTime("26-jan-1969 at 3:21:00.123 pm");
DateTime dob4=new DateTime("1969-01-26 15:21:00.123456 PM PST");
</pre>

<h2>DateTime's Formatter</h2>
<p>You've probably used a java.text.SimpleDateFormat class to format a java.util.Date.  POJava's DateTime class has a built-in
method for creating similar output by allowing you to pass a format to an overlayed "toString()" method.  It is compatible with
formats used for SimpleDateFormat, but also includes support for fractional seconds down to the nanosecond.</p>
<p>If you really prefer using a separate class like DateFormat or SimpleDateFormat, then you might also try
POJava's DateTimeFormat class.</p>
<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
<p>The DateTime parser will include the TimeZone as part of the calculation.  Java supplies a default set of TimeZone's, but not all popular time
zones are supported.  POJava works with this infrastructure, but also allows you to easily add your own timezones to the list.  If you know of
a time zone that is already defined, you can use POJava to define an alias time zone name to reference that same TimeZone.  Additionally, you
can configure the parser to interpret the arrangement of the Month and Day order of fields to support the European DD/MM/YYYY instead of the
Western MM/DD/YYYY format.</p>
<h3>Global Settings</h3>
<pre>
DateTimeConfig.globalEuropeanDateFormat();
DateTime dt1=new DateTime("01/02/2003");
DateTimeConfig.globalAmericanDateFormat();
DateTime dt2=new DateTime("02/01/2003");
assertEquals(dt1, dt2);
</pre>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>While use of four-digit years is recommended to remove ambiguity, POJava's DateTime parser will still
interpret a two-digit year as falling in the range from 20 years into the future to 80 years into the past.
This covers most cases, such as upcoming events or birthdays.  If you know for certain you are parsing
a past date, such as a birthday, you can support two digit dates very reliably with one additional step.
If you see a birthday interpreted in the future, subtract a century.  That's it.</p>
<pre>
DateTime dob=new DateTime(gatheredTime);
if (dob.getMillis() > System.currentTimeMillis()) {
    dob=dob.add(CalendarUnit.CENTURY, -1);
}
