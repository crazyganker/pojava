<p>ResultSetProcessors process ResultSets.  Each ResultSetProcessor is
responsible for performing some set of actions on a ResultSet, typically
returning a count of rows processed.  Some process single rows, and
others process multiple rows.  Most use a TableMap to translate rows
from the ResultSet into POJO's for further processing.
