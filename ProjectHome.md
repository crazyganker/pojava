POJava is a set of very lightweight support utilities focused intently on simplicity, reusability and stability.  Our goal is to make it fast and intuitive to build applications without weighing the developer down with framework implementation.  All code will meet a few well-defined standards before being incorporated into the API with the commitment of supporting all public interfaces indefinitely.

POJava utilities will cater to ordinary looking portable representations of data, starting with POJO's (plain old java objects) and POX (plain old xml).  We'll provide a very simple but servicable persistence layer that will be both flexible and tidy.  While we may end up competing in the same space as a number of frameworks, our goal is to be useful to developers no matter what frameworks they choose.
