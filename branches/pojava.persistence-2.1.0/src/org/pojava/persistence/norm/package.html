<p>Norm is a package for normalizing the representation of relational data
definition structures independent of their origins.</p>
<p>The goal is to serve as a simple universal translator between database
DDL variations.  If you can translate a platform to Norm, and Norm to a
platform, then you can easily translate your platform to an unknown platform,
provided it can translate itself to and from Norm.</p>
