<p>A Query, for purposes of this package, describes a set of selection
criteria for a relational data model, regardless of whether it is, for
example, from a SQL database.</p>
<p>When using POJava, you'll notice that the DaoTool supports several
methods ending in "ByQuery".  These methods are designed to support
custom queries you create by extending AbstractQuery, which then support
interfaces that translate those queries to one or more supporting
persistence implementations, such as SQL, REST, WS*, Google Data API,
or other API's such as one might use for an ESB.</p>
<p>This package includes one such interface, PreparedSqlProvider, that
is understood by methods in the DaoTool.  When properly implemented,
your code will completely abstract its queries into classes serving a
specific object type, such as WidgetQuery.class serving a Widget bean.
The WidgetQuery can be used by a WidgetDao, which wraps any combination
of methods from the DaoTool, plus any custom methods desired.</p>
