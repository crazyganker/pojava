Util contains pure utility code.  In general, when a POJava utility consists 
of only static methods, it will have the suffix "Tool" at the end.

Note that I'm not out to try to duplicate the effort of Apache Commons-- 
you'll find some excellent utilities there-- rather, I'm seeking to have
a small core on which to build some higher level tools without an abundance
of dependent packages.
