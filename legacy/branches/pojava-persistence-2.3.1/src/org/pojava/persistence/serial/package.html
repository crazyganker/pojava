<p>The serial package of POJava Persistence provides serialization
and deserialization of Java Objects to and from XML.</p>
<p>While it can be customized to support a wide variety of externally
defined XML documents, its main thrust is to make it convenient to
produce XML as a simple import and export of POJOs into a portable
format.  I wanted to make it very natural, for example, to store an
object into a varchar or text field in a database without having to
give it much thought or to manage some external set of object to
XML mappings.</p>
