<p>Utilities for dealing with data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>These utilities are based on the use of Object Relational Mapping
(ORM) to simplify persistence of an object to storage.  The SqlTool
handles the direct interaction with the database, and the DaoTool
provides a consistent set of common CRUD operations which each of
your Dao objects can wrap in their methods, layering on any additional
customizations, such as logging, security, or performance monitoring.</p>
<p>As with POJava Utilities, utility classes ending in "Tool" provide
a set of static methods.</p>
