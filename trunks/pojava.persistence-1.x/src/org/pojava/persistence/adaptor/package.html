<p>Adaptors tranform data, or more specifically, data held in Bindings,
where a Binding specifies both a Type (a Java Class) and a Value (which
may be null, hence the necessity of the Type field).</p>
<p>POJava uses Bindings extensively, both in the Adaptors and in the
BoundString object.  Understanding Bindings is key to understanding how
to get the most out of using POJava.  In this case, an Adaptor performs
data transformation on a Binding, returning either a new
Binding or the same Binding as a result if no transformation is needed.</p>
