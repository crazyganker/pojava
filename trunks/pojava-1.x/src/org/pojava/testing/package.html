Objects that aid in unit testing-- currently, by providing an InitialContext normally
created by your application server for JNDI.

It is common for a DataSource to be retrieved from a JNDI registry.  The
registry is usually configured by the application server, so that when your
unit tests are running standalone, there is no JNDI registry.  This package addresses
that problem by creating an in-memory mockup of JNDI that your unit tests can
have at.

Example: <code>
context=JNDIRegistry.getInitialContext();
Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
DataSource ds=new DriverManagerDataSource("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres", "pojava", "popojava");
context.S		
</code>
